Build a responsive web app called “TaxEase – Nigeria Tax Calculator (2025 Reform Ready).”

The app helps Nigerians estimate their personal income and digital asset taxes under the 2025 Nigeria Tax Reform Act, which takes effect in January 2026.

🧩 Core Features

Tax Calculation Logic (2025 mode):

Combine income + business + crypto gains

Apply reliefs:

Rent relief = 20% of rent (max ₦500,000)

Pension + NHF + other deductions

Apply progressive PIT rates:

7% on first ₦300,000

11% on next ₦300,000

15% on next ₦500,000

19% on next ₦500,000

21% on next ₦1,600,000

24% on next ₦3,200,000

25% on anything above

If Small Company → ₦0 tax

Output both Tax Owed and After-Tax Income

Legacy Mode (Pre-2025):
